# 🎓 GenAI Final Project — RAG-Based Q&A Chatbot for MSADS

This repository contains the **front-end UI** for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot, built as part of the GenAI final project at the University of Chicago. The chatbot provides conversational Q&A about the **MS in Applied Data Science (MSADS)** program.

This front-end is developed using **Streamlit**, and supports API integration with back-end retrieval and LLM modules.
